# Projects_
Here I'm sharing projects on which I was working on. 

Guided projects are the learning projects, which gave me the possibility to put my newly aquired Data Scientist skills to real-life problems, with a little assist from the creators of the DataCamp course.

Kaggle Competitions projects are projects on Kaggle datasets. 

Real Life Projects, are samples of real life projects, which I was able to participate in.
